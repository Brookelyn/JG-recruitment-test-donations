Thanks very much for taking the time to consider my application for a role at JustGiving!

I allocate approximately four hours to work on a technical test, and this is what I've done within that rough timeframe.

Specific things I'd have done with more time:
* More informative loading UI
* Better responsiveness, specifically in regards to header and footer
* Moved data fetching functions into seperate file
* Add tests

And obviously when it comes to the design, I'd like to tweak it. Endlessly. :)

I bootstrapped this demo with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# To run the project

After cloning project, in project folder run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The project should now be running at localhost:3000.
